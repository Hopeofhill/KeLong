Degrons have central roles in both protein quality control and intracellular signalling pathways, and mutations that dysregulate degron activity are associated with a wide range of diseases, including cancer, immunological disorders and neurodegeneration. The number of well-defined degrons remains sparse relative to the ~600 E3 ubiquitin ligases encoded in the human genome. Recent advances in high-throughput degron discovery technologies have accelerated progress in this area, expanding the number of N- and C-terminal degrons, internal degrons and ubiquitin-independent degrons defined experimentally at high resolution. In this Review, we discuss the latest insights into the molecular mechanisms through which degrons act, their functional importance and their relevance in human disease, and consider how bifunctional molecules harness degrons to enable targeted protein degradation for therapeutic benefit.",

Accumulating evidence from preclinical models, however, argues against such a clearcut distinction, for two main reasons. First, at least in mammals, apoptotic caspases are generally dispensable for cells to succumb to apoptotic stimuli but instead regulate the kinetic and microenvironmental manifestations of the cellular demise in the context of a complex interplay with other cell death pathways. Second, most (if not all) mammalian caspases have evolved into positive or negative regulators of inflammatory processes, either directly or via their ability to control apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death modalities. Here we discuss the molecular mechanisms through which mammalian caspases regulate inflammation, with emphasis on the ability of apoptotic caspases to suppress inflammatory responses in support of preserved organismal homeostasis.",
